# ðŸŒŸ Diabetes Prediction Project ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction Project**! ðŸŽ‰ This exciting project aims to analyze diabetes data collected from health exams and family history. By harnessing the power of data management, captivating data visualizations, and cutting-edge machine learning techniques, our mission is to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a treasure trove of comprehensive information on individuals' health exam results, encompassing vital factors related to diabetes such as blood glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and family history of illness. This robust dataset serves as the foundation for our thrilling analysis and prediction models.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

As data scientists, we've embarked on an exhilarating journey that unfolds in several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: We embark on a quest to cleanse the data of missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. With our astute feature engineering techniques, we extract hidden gems of relevant information, empowering our predictive models.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Armed with powerful data visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices, we unveil captivating insights into the intricate relationships between different variables.

3. **Feature Selection**: We wield the power of feature selection techniques to reveal the most potent variables for our noble cause, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our prediction models. With every choice we make, we bring ourselves closer to triumph.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Armed with an arsenal of mighty algorithmsâ€”logistic regression, random forests, upsampling and explainable boostingâ€”we forge predictive models that possess the power to discern between the diabetic and the non-diabetic. Our models become beacons of hope in the darkness, shining a light on those in need.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Through rigorous evaluation using sacred metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC and F1-score, we gauge the prowess of our models. These metrics serve as a compass, guiding us to the most formidable model, the one that will lead us to victory.
